🧠 Generative AI Product Recommender System
This project presents a smart product recommendation system developed as a demonstration of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to real-world product discovery scenarios. It allows users to input natural language queries (e.g., job descriptions or role summaries) and receive precise recommendations for relevant SHL products.
